// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis = "This is the second step. Here is where the general requirements of the software will be concidered. Analysis is an important step because it helps developers know what they will need to begin to work on after the planing stage."
const Design = "At the third step designers create an outline or skeleton of what the project will look like. This is still occuring before the developement has officially begun."
const Implementation = "The forth step is where the actual developement begins to take place. Once all the planning stages(1-3) are finished developers will begin to implement or develope the software."
const Testing = "The fifth step is to make sure that the software build actually works and is useable. This will uncover any flaws in the software and will help work out bugs before the software is deployed."
const Maintain = "The last step is to maintain the software. Although the project it's self may be complete, the developers work is far from finished. The product needs to be updated to ensure it's continued use and for customer satisfaction."
